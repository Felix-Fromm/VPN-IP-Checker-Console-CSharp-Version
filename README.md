# VPN Checker C# Version

This Console Application is working with a VPN API by https://vpnapi.io.

In order to Use it, you need to create an account at https://vpnapi.io to get an API-Key.
Then you start the program and it will ask you for your Key, type in your Key (or paste it) and press ENTER
Your Key will be saved for future uses, for a new Key just delete the config.ff file.

Config Path: %LocalAppData% -> IP-VPN-Checker
On Windows: C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\IP-VPN-Checker

This is nothing new or special, just a random program that I programmed some time ago.

If you see a part who could be done better pls contact me and inform me.
I would love to get advice to improve my programming skills.
